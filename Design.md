Redesign the app using a style inspired by Abstract (abs.xyz). Apply a minimal, futuristic, and high-contrast dark/light theme.

Color scheme: Black/dark backgrounds with white/light text, and a mint-green accent (#00FF85) used sparingly.

Typography: Bold sans-serif for headlines, clean sans-serif for body. Maintain generous spacing and clear hierarchy.

UI elements: Rounded corners (2xl), subtle shadows, glowing hover states.

Layout: Keep sections clean, minimal, and balanced with whitespace. Use alternating dark/light backgrounds for contrast across different pages.

Buttons: Pill-shaped, black or white with neon green highlights.

Icons/Graphics: Futuristic, minimal, with optional playful illustrations.

Consistency: The same rules apply to every page â€” navigation, cards, modals, and footers should all follow the same style.

Mood: Confident, tech-forward, premium, but approachable.
